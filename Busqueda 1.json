          "Frustrated in his attempts to assassinate Yee, who is an important official in Japanese-ruled Shanghai, Old Wu, who has lost his wife and two sons as well as two women who had attempted to seduce Yee, now recruits Kuang, Mai Tai Tai, and their troupe of drama students from Hong Kong University in yet another attempt to do away with Yee. Mai Tai Tai is chosen to befriend Yee, which she does by posing as the wife of Mak, befriending Yee's wife and her female friends, and then eventually befriending Yee himself. Even though both get together, they do end up going separate ways, only to meet again four years later. This time Mai is all set to entrap Yee at Chandni Chowk Jewellers which is owned by an East Indian man named Khalid Saiduddin. The question does remain: Will she and her troupe succeed?",
          "Naive Wong Chia Chi is a college student in 1938 Hong Kong, to where many mainland Chinese have escaped from the bloodshed of the Sino-Japanese War. Her widowed father, abandoning her in China, escapes himself to England with her younger brother. On campus, she innocently gets involved with the politically active theater troupe led by Kuang Yu Min. Their plays protest the war, with Yu Min's stance particularly against any Chinese who collaborates with the Japanese. The productions' primary goal is to raise money for the resistance. Many Chinese do collaborate with the Japanese in part to maintain their upper class lifestyle. No longer solely content to hear the chants of \"China will not fall\" from their anti-Japanese audiences, Yu Min wants to venture into more direct activism by killing one of those collaborating with the Japanese, namely a Shanghai bigwig hiding out in Hong Kong named Mr. Yee to who they can get access through an old friend of Yu Min's. Despite all of them realizing that they know nothing about killing or espionage, they all agree. The expensive plot, funded by wealthy troupe member Liang Jun Sheng, involves Chia Chi acting as Mrs. Mak, the wife of a wealthy businessman, played by her fellow actor, Auyang Ling Wen. Although not originally the plan, Chia Chi becomes the center of the plot as she is the one who captures the attention of both Mr. and Mrs. Yee. The final act becomes more and more difficult to execute due to Mr. Yee's extremely cautious nature and despite his overwhelming evident lust for Mrs. Mak. The plot, which eventually involves those in the resistance who may have more expertise in espionage and killing, which moves to Shanghai and which covers the span of four years, changes Chia Chi fundamentally as a person, especially due to her developing love/hate relationship with Mr. Yee.",

          "Somewhere in Italy 1944Joey (Timothy Van Patten) a solider for the US arm sits reading a pulp science fiction magazine on a bridge at the edge of a small Italian village. Mittens (Art LaFleur) another solider pesters him for a magazine with blondes from outer space on the cover. Joey tells him he swapped the magazine for a packet of cigarettes to a soldier is G Company.Elsewhere in the village Sargent Stone (Tim Thomerson) checks on his medic, Phillips (Bruce McGuire) whos previously injured his ankle. In the middle of the discussion the radioman, Ferguson (Eugene Brell) reports he cant raise HQ all he is getting is strange electronic sounds through the radio. Sarge checks his compass and notices it is spinning erratically, he checks Ferguson's compass which is equally uselessUnseen by the US soldiers a squad of Germans troops form up and advance on the town in preparation for an attack.Back at the bridge Joey and Mittens have their photograph taken by a soldier who introduces himself as Charlie Dolan (Biff Manard) Joey recognizes the name as a famous writer, and wants to know if Dolan is going to do a story on his unit.Sarge checks in with the Lieutenant (John Leamer) and reports the radio being out, and so far nothing has been heard of the other squads who should have arrived at the town by now. The Lieutenant dismisses Stones concern, and is sure the relief troops are approaching over a nearby hill. He goes to investigate, and is killed by the approaching Germans.The rest of the American troops take cover as the Germans continue to advance. Seeing the enemy strength Sarge orders his men to pull out of the village and make for a nearby wood. During the retreat both Ferguson and Phillips are killed. Sarge remains behind and sets up an ambush that stops the German advance.Regrouping in the woods, only four of the original squad including Sarge has survived the attack. Mittens is angry at Sarge. If hed taken a battlefield commission, the new Lieutenant would not have been in charge and Sarge would not have allowed the ambush to happen.As they move through the woods it becomes increasingly obvious they are lost. Sarge tries his compass a number of times without successUnseen by the soldiers a creature with a three fingered hand watches them from a concealed position.A german mortar position spots the Americans and fires. The round hits a tree which begins to fall on the men taking shelter. The unseen creature launches a device that disintegrates the tree debris instantly. The American move out of range of the Germans, and finally take shelter in an old abandoned farmhouse for the night. Dolan begins questioning Mittens about his relationship with Sarge. He wonders if Sarge can get them out of the trouble they are in. Dolans notices Mittens gun has the name Velma written on it. Dolan wonders if that is his wife, till Mittens admits it is a girl who beat him up in the 1st Grade.Joey is sent to take the first watch. As he circles the farmhouse he hears strange noises and the sound of someone approaching. He goes to investigate and finds a cluster of strange glowing eggs on the ground and a strange hairy creature standing over themThinking he imagined the incident, he goes back inside the farmhouse and burns his science fiction magazine. Satisfied he resumes his sentry duty. Next morning he confides in Dolans what he saw, and fears he is losing his mind. Dolan is interested in his story. Dolan is less concerned and thinks he saw some wildlife and his imagination took overMittens reports from his watch that hes seen a deer in the woods. Dolans, against Mittens best judgment is determined to try and kill it, and the pair goes out on the hunt. They find the location Mittens saw the animal and Dolens begins tracking itAt the farmhouse Sarge wakes finds Joey who tells him about the hunt. Sarge is furious and immediately goes looking for the other two menThe two men on the hunt crest a hill and find an abandoned SS camp. Dolan wants to go and investigate, but Mittens insists they go back to meet up with Sarge and Joey.Joey finds a piece of metal on the forest floor. When he picks it up he screams in pain from the intense cold coming from the metalAt the SS camp Dolans has ignored Mittens and snuck into the camp to see whats going on. He finds a series of maps and drawings of what he thinks is a new Nazi secret weapon.As Sarge and Joey are still trying to hook up with Mittens and Dolans, they stumble across the wreckage of what appears to be a downed space ship.Dolans is caught looking through the documentation and while in the process of being unarmed, Mittens sneaks in and shoots the guard. As Dolans and Mittens make good their escape more Germans arrive and capture the menThe Sarge and Joey find a way inside the wreck and begin exploring to see if there are any survivors of the crash. They can hear machinery noises coming from the lower areas of the ship and try to locate the engines. They fall through an opening and encounter the corpse of one of the creatures Joey saw the previous evening.\nJoey finds an empty chair in the chamber they have entered. Joey surmises the creature he saw the previous evening is the survivor who would occupy the empty seat. As they explore the control systems Sarge sees a group of German soldiers approaching the shipAs the Germans move through the ship, Joey finds a ventilation shaft leading to the exterior of the ship and the two men make good their escape. As they escape they hear two Germans discuss the arrest of Charlie Dolan.\nSarge decides the best course of action is to blow up the ship, especially as the Germans have control of the wreckage. Joey is ordered to throw an hand grenade into one of the engine bays which triggers a series of explosions that kill all the Germans and destroy the remains of the shipAt the SS camp German soldiers unload a cage with what appears to be the captured pilot from the ship. The commander of the camp, Col. Manheim (Peter Boom) introduces himself to the captives and begins the process of interrogating them for any information they might have about the downed spaceship.A scientist interrupts the interrogation. The creature being held in the cage has morphed into a large pine cone shaped egg that appears to be glowing. When Manheim touches the egg, the creature erupts from its cover and attacks Manhiem.During the night, Adolph Hitler (Alviero Martin) visits the site to inspect the captured alien. He stops for a moment to examine the prisoners. Mitten realizes his hands are no longer tied and throws a punch breaking Hitler nose. After arranging the transport of the alien to Berlin he leaves.The next morning the alien is loaded on a truck for Berlin, and the two prisoners are held in the dog kennels. To their surprise Joey arrives dressed as a German and explains the escape plan to the men. Sarges plan involves also capturing the alien and see if it can be transported back to the allied lines.The plan unravels as one of the German officers realizes Joey is American, rather than waiting for dark they make their escape in broad daylight. Reaching the truck housing the alien, they are surprised to find Sarge at the wheel During the escape the truck runs off the road. As a German prepares to fire a rocket launcher at the truck the alien intercedes and sets a force field around truck making the attack ineffective. After the attack they continue on foot taking the alien with themAs night falls they take refuge in an empty family tomb. Mittens doesnt want to disrespect the dead and decides to stand guard outside, till the sound of wild animals drives him inside. As they settle in Sarge tells Dolans to come outside with him. Sarge then confronts the reporter about what he really knows.Two days ago Dolans is dropped off with their unit. Now they have a spaceship, alien, and SS units after them. Dolans pleads it is all coincidence and he is really there to write a story about Sarge. He explains to Stone that he is now a legend among the GIs its been reported at least 20 times hes been killed, but he always comes throughIn the tomb, Mittens and Joey accidentally discover the creature eat tobacco. It offers to swap a small device for cigarettes. Joey fools with the thing trying to understand its operation when a small green beam jumps from it, connects with Joeys head then creates a replica of a woman (Anita Zagaria) who immediately seduces JoeyWhile the two men are distracted by the woman, the alien grabs a gun. Rather than shoot the men he uses it to illustrate who he is and what he is doing. In the morning the alien is gone. All that is left is the remains of an egg. Joey summises the creature creates the eggs to sleep in. The four men track the creature back to the site of the crash. They encounter a second spaceship, with a different group of aliens, tey appear to be a rescues partyOne of the aliens takes on human form and speaks briefly to the aliens, only to discover the alien they have been protecting is a female. As the spacecraft is readying to leave a German tank arrives on the scene and begins shelling the spacecraft. The alien fires a small projectile at the tank destroying it instantly. Joey is killed in the attack.Joey is buried by the Americans as the aliens try to repair their ship, Dolans reports a German patrol is approaching. Sarge asks the aliens for help but they refuse. Resolved to stop the Nazis succeeding Sarge leads his squad out to try and ambush the enemy.The ambush is partially successful however the Americans are out of ammunition. Sarge offers to surrender and meets with the commander of the Germans to make the arrangements. Sarge approaches the officer and produces a hidden hand grenade that blows the German up and kills Sarge.Dolans and Mittens begin to consider retreat when a second German patrol arrives in their rear. Expecting to die the men are surprised when a ray weapon begins killing Germans. The aliens have had a change of heart and have decided to help the Americans. In a matter of minutes the Germans are defeatedThat night Dolan and Mitten say good bye to the aliens as they leave in their repaired spacecraft\nLater as Dolan and Mittens discuss their options they encounter the Sarge standing in the middle of the road, somehow he's survived the explosion and heads of to cross back to allied linesChapman_Glen@yahoo.com"

          "The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by Father Lankester Merrin following the horrific events he witnessed during World War II. Many years before the events in The Exorcist, the young Father Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist) travels to East Africa. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in occupied Holland during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. The collector asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon before the British can find it. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in East Africa but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated. Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the British military officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man with visible boils on his face. And he meets Sarah, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin's translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribemen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.Merrin visits the dig site. Only the dome is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction were completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it is near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.Merrin is determined to learn more about the archeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in Nairobi. Merrin visits Bession's tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession. But when he enters Bession's room, he discovers Bession has carved a swastika on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was \"free.\" Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not possessed but rather \"touched\" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by hyenas that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother ripped to pieces. Merrin begins to suspect that something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region. There are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village. However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty. Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded, leading to its subsequent discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Francis also reveals that the church stands on the supposed site where Satan fell to earth after the war in heaven, and it was constructed by early Christians in an attempt to purify the evil that resides there.Beneath the church lies the ruins of an even older temple but not a Christian one. Rather, in the ruins under the church, Merrin and his allies find demonic icons, and other signs of evil and Satanism. This land is where he first encounters the demon that calls itself Pazuzu, which he will encounter again in The Exorcist. This is the demon that \"brushed\" Bession (driving him insane) and Joseph (making him ill).At the end of the movie, the dig's doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but dies. Dr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and history has repeated itself. 50 (and 1500) years ago, everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to Rome and meets with the collector at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, the collector replies, \"But you found something....Didn't you?\"... As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals."

But, can Merrin remain unscathed in the battle with man's unseen arch-enemy? Will this encounter with the forces of darkness affect Merrin for the rest of his life?",
          "Father Lankester Merrin became a non-believer after seeing the atrocities committed on the innocent during WW II. He has since moved to Africa to work as an archaeologist. There, an antiques dealer comes to him with a request. An old Christian Byzantine church has been unearthed in Kenya, surprisingly intact, as if it were buried right after its completion. Merrin is asked to find an ancient relic believed to be buried in the church. Once Merrin arrives at the excavation site, however, inexplicable tragedies strike the innocent people. Merrin soon discovers that an ancient evil force has been set free due to the excavation, and if he wants to stop it, he will have to start believing once again."

At the time of the raid the camp held about 500 prisoners.The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police.Meanwhile at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan.Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese.In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings. Once recovered, she escaped to Bataan, where she served as a nurse with the Philippine Commonwealth troops and recognized guerrilla units until liberation in February 1945.(Source: Wikipedia)"

She is finally cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II German uniforms.The movie then moves to seven medical students on Easter vacation. They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her. He finds the body of the hiker in his tent, but then falls through snow into a cave below.The other students find an old wooden box filled with valuables and German decorations hidden under the floor. They consider taking and selling it, but eventually put it back, although some of them keep items. After it gets dark, one of the students, Chris (Jenny Skavlan), goes to the outhouse, but is murdered while on the toilet. The others go outside to look for her; they do not find her, but do find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow.A little later, Chris's severed head appears at the window - the zombies have arrived. Erlend (Jeppe Laursen) is murdered before the remaining students manage to seal the cabin windows and door and survive the night.The following morning, Vegard comes round in the cave. He discovers World War II German firearms and helmets and a swastika flag, as well as Sara's severed head; she was the woman being pursued at the beginning of the film. He is attacked by zombies, but manages to escape from the cave. He is badly bitten in the neck by one zombie, but manages to escape on the snowmobile, which he equips with an MG 34 machine gun.Meanwhile, the remaining four students in the cabin have decided to split up. The two men, Martin (Vegar Hoel) and Roy (Stig Frode Henriksen), attempt to distract the zombies, while the two women, Hanna (Charlotte Frogner) and Liv (Evy Kasseth Røsten), run for the cars and go for help. Martin and Roy hole up in the cabin, but then accidentally set fire to it with molotov cocktails. They then discover that the shed next to the cabin contains a chainsaw, hammers and axes and equip themselves.The main group of zombies attacks. Martin and Roy manage to fight them off, aided by Vegard, who returns on the snowmobile. Vegard is killed during the fighting however and Martin accidentally kills his girlfriend Hanna with his hatchet, who has not managed to reach the cars (Liv has already been killed by the zombies). Herzog (Ørjan Gamst) arrives with another group of zombies, including SS men, but Martin and Roy also manage to fight them off. Martin is bitten on the arm and cuts it off with the chainsaw to avoid turning into a zombie. Herzog then raises many other zombies from all around and the two students run. Roy falls and is killed.Martin finally realises that the zombies are after their loot and runs to the burnt-out remains of the cabin. He gives the box of loot to Herzog and runs for the cars. The zombies do not appear to follow him. However, on reaching the car, a coin falls out of Martin's pocket. Swearing, he looks round to see Herzog smashing the car window."

In exchange for hiding her, they expect her to learn Bible verses. One day, a crippled Allied bomber drops its payload on the farmhouse, killing everyone except Rachel. Rob (Michiel Heisman), a young man from a neighboring farm, hides her in the family's greenhouse. That night, Van Gein (Peter Blok), a police officer, arrives to tell them that the Nazis know that Rachel is in the area and will hunt her down.

He and Ellis are to pose as husband and wife so the Nazis will not search their luggage on the train; the luggage is actually full of weaponry. But when the Nazi soldiers on the train clearly do intend to search all baggage, a new plan is needed. Ellis takes the bags and enters a private compartment occupied by SD Colonel Müntze (Sebastian Koch). The Nazis don't search Müntze's compartment. Ellis and Müntze are clearly attracted to each other and she accepts an offer to visit him at his office. Hans is clearly jealous.A truck carrying the British guns crashes in front of the soup kitchen. Kuiper's son, Tim (Ronald Armbrust) was driving and is arrested by the Gestapo. While the others go into hiding, Ellis arranges a meeting with Müntze hoping that she can persuade him to release Tim. Knowing he is an avid stamp collector, she takes some rare Dutch stamps to him. He invites her to a Nazi party. There she sees SS commandant Günter Franken (Waldemar Kobus) and recognizes him as the Nazi who led the ambush against the refugee boat. Although she is sickened at his sight, she manages to sing at the party later. She and Müntze return to his suite to make love. He intuits that she is Jewish from her dyed blond hair but has fallen in love with her. She accepts a job in his office and begins work the following day. There she meets Ronnie, who is Franken's secretary/sex partner. Franken gives them a report indicating that Tim has confessed everything and is to be executed, however, Müntze refuses to sign the execution order.Ellis sees Smaal at Nazi headquarters and learns that he and Müntze have negotiated a cease fire -- if the Resistance ceases its attacks against the Nazis, the Nazis will cease its violent reprisals against Dutch civilians. However, when a hidden microphone placed by Ellis in Franken's office reveals that Franken and Van Gein have been working together to kill and rob Jews trying to escape into Allied territory, a controversy amongst the Resistance fighters ensues. Van Gein is heard asking where Franken gets his information as to where the Jews are hiding, which Franken refuses to answer. Ellis wants vengeance for her family but Kuipers refuses to risk breaking the truce because his son will be killed. He betrays a level of anti-semitism when he asks if Jewish lives are any more important than Dutch lives. Behind Kuipers' back, Hans and several others agree to kidnap Van Gein and make it look like he went underground to protect himself. Hans tries to drug Van Gein with chloroform but it doesn't work because the medicine has passed its expiration date. When Van Gein nearly escapes, they are forced to kill him and dump his body in the canal. That night, Müntze confronts Ellis about her participation in the Resistance.Smaal procures the building plans for the Nazi headquarters from a friend at city hall; the building used to be a bank. A plan is devised to sneak into the building during a party in honor of Hitler's birthday. Using information given to him by Ellis, Müntze accuses Franken of hoarding property and valuables confiscated from Jews, a capital offense. When a search of Franken's safe comes up empty, Franken accuses Müntze of negotiating with terrorists -- the Resistance. Müntze is sentenced to death, and Franken announces that forty hostages will be executed in retaliation for the murder of Van Gein. The rescue effort will now be more complex, and Ellis insists that Müntze be one of those liberated because she is in love with him. That night, she leaves a coal chute door open for Hans and the others to enter, then goes to sing at the party. The Resistance members enter the building and free many of the prisoners. However, they are then ambushed by Nazi soldiers. Only Hans and one other Resistance member survive. Franken takes Ellis to his office and uses the hidden microphone, which he knows about, to make it seem like Ellis has been collaborating with him against the Resistance. Kuipers vows to kill her. But Franken already intends to, along with Müntze. That night, Ronnie uses her body as a diversion while another sympathetic soldier frees Ellis and Müntze from their cells.A few days later, the Germans surrender and World War II (in Europe) ends. Ellis and Müntze make their way back to The Hague. They go to see Smaal, who they believe to be the one who had betrayed the Resistance fighters and Jews to Franken. He denies it and claims to have proof of the real culprit which he intends to take to the Canadian military government controlling the city. However, before he can do so, an unknown assailant kills Smaal and his wife. Resistance fighters trap Müntze and Ellis, although she takes Smaal's notebook. Franken attempts to escape by boat with the loot taken from the Jews but Hans kills him.Muntze, in the custody of the Canadian army, is sentenced to death by his former commanding officer, General Käutner, who argues to his Canadian counterpart that Nazi officers still have the authority to punish their own officers for misconduct. Müntze is executed for his contact with Communists in the Resistance. Ellis is kept in a pen with other Dutch accused of collaborating with the Nazis. She and her fellow prisoners are treated deplorably by other local residents, an incident that is broken up by Hans, who berates his countrymen for acting like their Nazi occupiers during the war. Hans, who is now considered a hero of the Resistance, finds Ellis and takes her to his office. On the way, they distribute some chocolate bars to children. In his office, he shows her the money and valuables he took from Franken and reveals that Müntze was executed. Ellis breaks down in tears. Hans tells her that he is giving her a sedative but actually injects her with a lethal amount of insulin. He was the traitor in the Resistance and feels he must kill Ellis to cover his tracks. But when he goes to his window to accept the cheers of an adoring crowd, Ellis wolfs down a chocolate bar to counteract the insulin and escapes with Smaal's black book.She takes the evidence to Kuipers, who is at a nearby mass grave where the body of his son has been uncovered. They leave to find Hans, who is trying to escape the city with the Jewish money and valuables. They find him on a country road, using the same method that was used to smuggle Rachel into the Resistance -- the coffin with the hidden vent. Although he offers to give some of the money to them, Kuipers and Ellis seal off his air supply and let him suffocate to death. On the banks of the river, they debate what to do with the money.In 1956, at the Kibbutz Stein, which was founded with the Jewish money, Rachel and her family disappear behind the fences as armed Israeli soldiers arrive to guard it from an unseen enemy, marking the beginning of the Suez Crisis.In this movie appears Christian Berkel who will later play the role of Fritz Shimon Haber in Haber (2008)."

We see death in concentration camps after liberation, from disease or even from eating too much. We learn of pogroms murdering those who return home. We see the squalor of displaced persons camps. Facing strict British immigration limits into Palestine, many sought passage illegally, often ending up in locked camps in Cyprus.

So Navajos were recruited to become what they call code talkers.

And to insure that the code is protected men are assigned to protect it at all costs.

          "The film begins in Africa, a picture of a boy riding his bicycle through the open plains carrying a note of great significance to the main characters. A once prominent Jewish family has been torn apart by the promise of war in their homeland. WWII is on the verge of breaking out across Europe and the Nazi party's stranglehold is tightening around Germany's neck. Cut to an icy glade in Germany where many children are sledding and playing in the snow. A mother and daughter are sledding together down a snowcapped hill; Regina, afraid of her own shadow and even little dogs, and her mother Jettel, an ambitious socialite. Still in Germany after Walter, a former lawyer (Regina's father/Jettel's husband) has fled to a farm in Kenya where he is working as the foreman but has caught malaria, Regina and Jettel are still living a life of comfort until they receive a letter from Walter. The letter beckons them to come to Kenya where the Nairoibi population of Jewish citizens has agreed to pay their fare into the country. In his letter, Walter begs Jettel to bring an icebox, mosquito netting and to leave the China at home as it will be no use in their new home. Max, Walter's father, wishes the family well but does not wish to accompany them as he feels that everything will be okay within a year or two.Cut back to Kenya where Walter is still sick with malaria, the farm's African cook Ouwour dismisses the normal Quinine treatment prescribed by Süsskind, a German expatriate and family friend, in favor of an African herbal treatment and miraculously Walter is healed. Upon being healed, a bond is formed between Walter and Ouwour when Walter gives his former judicial robes to Ouwour for curing him, stating that \"he no longer needs the robe, he was a lawyer in his first life; he needs to think with his braun, not with his brain now.Six months later, Regina and Jettel arrive in Rongai, Kenya with Walter. Walter recognizes immediately that Jettel has no desire to think of Africa as her new home and views it only as a stop in their lives as opposed to a second life. Regina on the other hand immediately forms a bond with Ouwour and begins to adapt to life in Kenya, befriending the local children and exploring her surroundings. Pan shortly into the future and Regina is becoming an independent child, no longer afraid of snow and small dogs. Süsskind comes to deliver supplies and stay with the family; Jettel naively asks how long he has been away from home, to which he replies \"this is my home.\" This is a sense of awakening for Jettel who until now has perceived their rickety farmhouse as only a place to stay. That night Walter and Jettel get into an argument because she had foolishly packed the china and finer goods and left the more important goods, pertinent to their surroundings, at home because she simply refused to let go of their former pampered lifestyle. With no other real companion than Ourwour, Regina begins to learn the lay of the land and the day to day of African life from him whereas Jettel still looks at him as almost a slave. She asks for his help to gather water in one scene, to which he replies that it is womans work yet she persists. He is mercilessly teased by the African women at the waterhole because he allows his ties to the family to outweigh tradition.Six months later, still on the farm, Jettel is still unhappy with their lack of plush surroundings and complains that she needs meat and is tired of eating \"slop.\" This bothers Walter who reluctantly and in anger informs her that they escaped Germany in the nick of time; the Nazi's had raided Jewish residences, businesses and synagogues and had sacked them all. Jettel finally begins to realize that Walter might have been right all along in his assessment that they had to leave Germany and that the Nazi's looked at the Jews as subhuman. On Nov. 10, 1938, Walter writes his father a letter begging him to leave and bring the family to Kenya before it is too late. Walter has realized that his parents are some of the most important people in his life because they were always there for him and now he wants to be there for his family, to provide the way his parents did. Meanwhile, Jettle still has biases against the black population and thinks they are dirty, warning Regina against anything unusual they might try to make her eat or do. Regina, already stubborn and curious, sets off to do just that.Fast forward a little and Jettle starts to realize Ouwour is more than a slave, that he is a smart individual. Six months after that, Regina and her father are loving their \"second life\" while Jettel is slowly coming to realize what life as an Afrcan is like. Shortly after Walter and Regina and Jettel begin to really adjust, war fully breaks out between the British and Nazi Germany and all Germans living in British holdings, including Jews, are imprisoned in internment camps. Walter goes to one, Jettel and Regina to another, Regina making Ouwour swear he will find them when they get out. For Walter it is a sad and lonely time where he questions whether two people are truly meant to be together for their whole lives. For Jettel it is a retreat back into civilization as the women are put up in a 5 star resort and pampered because the British cannot find other holdings for them. Though back in a pampered environment, Jettel realizes that Regina needs a stable home, even though she is flourishing still and learning English to boot, and that although Jettel prefers a life of luxury, she must be there to support her husband in his wishes. When the Jewish women of the camp begin to organize a drive to allow their husbands to be released, Jettel goes along with them and writes a letter to the Jewish community to help organize their release. Meanwhile, Walter begins to question why Germany would turn its back on them and becomes embittered against the Nazi regime. Once their release is organized, it is reliant upon the men of the family having a job to go back to. Because Walter has been terminated from his job as farm steward he cannot be released. Jettel arranges for a special visit to the Jewish community leader in Nairobi to ask for help yet she cannot arrange it. Upon learning of her wishes, a British soldier who speaks German and has had his eye on Jettel proposes that he can help arrange a job for Walter through some of his contacts but it comes at a cost; Jettel must sleep with him. With her marriage on the rocks and she wishing for her family's protection she willingly agrees. A job on a new farm in, Kenya is arranged and the family moves there. Once again, Regina flourishes in her African surroundings, absorbing culture and life as easily as if she were a native. However, Walter and Jettel have problems as he begins to suspect Jettel may have been unfaithful in order to provide his release. This, accompanied with his embitterment towards Germany lead him down a further path of despair and desolation towards his country. Finally accepting her life as woman of the farm, Jettel begins to enjoy her African surroundings and day to day life that comes with it.On October 2, 1940, the family receives word from his father that it is impossible for them to emigrate now and that he is afraid for his and his family's well-being. This is a major blow to Walter and he begins to resent Hitler and his regime to a point of no return. Shortly after, Owour miraculously finds the family on their new farm and once again restores a sense of order to them. Through his teachings, Regina truly befriends the village children and starts to become immersed in the culture. While Jettel does not mind, she begins to reinstate her wishes that Regina attend school and learn a proper education. Six months later, Regina begins to attend a British ran school where, although she is not exiled, she quickly becomes aware of how Jewish means different to others: no prayer participation, different rules, and somewhat of an unease coming from the other children. Although it is different, Regina thrives in her schoolwork, mainly due to her drive to achieve despite being different.While she is gone, Walter and Jettel struggle to find themselves back in love. Once again the question of love for life is brought up and although neither of them agree that they want to be with each other, they seem to recognize that they need each other even if it is only for one anothers sake. They reach out to each other in a philosophical form more than a loving form but it seems to keep them together. Regina visits sporadically and still fits right into the African culture of the village despite her preening at the British academy. Meanwhile, Jettel is settling more firmly into her role as woman-ward of the farm, taking more part in the day to day running of the farm. It is during one of Regina's visits that the family receives news that their relatives in Germany are being sent to concentration camps in Poland. Walter tells Jettel that Poland means death yet she is unwilling to accept that at face value even though she knows the truth in his words. While Walter becomes more and more embittered towards his former homeland and begins to want to do something about it, Jettel seems to embrace Africa more and more. At one point she cannot leave an old woman to die alone and a villager explains to her that this is the way of the tribe, to be with the ancestors. This seems to comfort Jettel in that she begins to realize that her family too will be with their ancestors.Months later, Süsskind visits and informs Walter that the British army is allowing Jewish Germans to enlist to fight against the Nazi's. While Jettel doesn't like his decision, she becomes resigned to it and assumes Walter's responsibility as head of the farm with Ouwour's help. Once Walter has left however, Susskind begins to visit the farm more often and plays upon Jettels need for companionship. This goes on for a few months until Walter returns on leave after the Allies landed in Normandy in force, symbolizing the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. Regina however, aware of her mother's former tryst with the British soldier, is unforgiving toward her friendliness with Süsskind and confronts her. This has two effects on her mother, the first of which is that she recognizes that Regina is becoming a woman and is struggling with her own rites of passage between becoming a woman of the \"civilized\" world and that of the African. The second is a new found respect for her husband and what he has done to keep the family safe and together. While being Jewish, she comes to recognize that faith and ethnicity have nothing to do with the perception of the outside world when they refuse to see you as human; much as she formerly thought of the African people when she first came to the continent from Germany. When Walter returns again on leave, he and Jettel share a passionate night in which they conceive a child. It is on this night that he informs her that their family is dead and that he has been chosen to go back to Germany to start a new western government there. In November of 1946, he receives his commission to go back and must prepare his family for their return. Neither Regina nor Jettel take this news well as they have both immersed themselves in the culture as he once had when he first arrived on the continent. The roles of husband and wife had now been reversed as she was happy finally as the proprietor of their farm instead of missing their former plush life in Germany and with him wishing to return to it.In the end it is Regina, reluctant as she is to return to a land of which all she remembers is fear that is the voice of reason between the two parties. Süsskind is at dinner with them when Walter announces his decision that they will return to Germany, Süsskind, the first to embrace Africa as his home cannot understand Walter's welcoming readiness to embrace Germany as his country once again, angering Walter. Jettel wants to stay at the farm and continue their life as framers while Walter wants to return to Germany and build a new, non-corrupt political system. They fight and he begins to leave back to the military base when a huge swarm of locusts come to the farm and threaten the entire crop. As he is leaving he sees the entire village go out to protect the crop and he remembers Regina's last words to him, \"mother needs you.\" He joins the fight against the locusts and when Jettel sees this it seems to rekindle the flame between them, she thinking he'd already made up his mind to leave. While he is still torn between love for country and love for family, Walter tells Jettel that he cannot and will not leave without her. She leaves the decision in his hands resigning herself to the love of her life over the love of her new country. When preparing to leave, Walter finds Ouwour preparing for a journey of his own, a long safari he must go on in order to keep from dying of heartbreak, so deep is his love for this family that has come to cherish his country. Walter finds the robe he gave him upon first meeting and tells him he has forgotten it. Ouwour responds that he has not forgotten it, it was never his to forget as Walter had told him that he didn't need it in his new life. Ouwour calmly informs Walter that he is returning back to his first life and leaving his second, so he will probably need the robe again. The family boards a train to return to Germany, thus coming full circle in their journey for a new life and having found it, being able to return eventually to their old one. However, this time, the return to their old life came with a new member of the family; a son was born on June 6, 1947, thus representing a new chapter to an old way of life. A tale of a complicated and complex journey of people searching for their own purpose and meaning in life and finally, in a roundabout way, finding it.In this movie appears Juliane Köhler who will later play the role of Clara, Fritz Shimon Haber's wife in Haber (2008)."

          "Pilot Noah Dugan is sleeping when two creditors burst in and threaten him. They tell him he has 24 hours to come up with $5,000 and a week to come up with an unspecified remainder. They rough him up and leave.Dugan goes out looking for work, but nobody will hire him. In desperation, he goes to a friend, Stoney, who tells him about a cargo run. Dugan asks what kind of plane. Stoney is evasive at first, then finally shows him the plane -- an old B-29 into which animals are being loaded. Dugan refuses, saying animals and planes don't mix. Trying to convince Dugan to fly the run, Stoney introduces him to Bernadette LaFleur, a missionary with an orphanage who is taking the animals to a remote tropical island, where she plans to show the natives how to raise them. Bernadette asks how soon they can leave. Dugan says never, and tells her to get her money back from Stoney -- fast. Stoney says the money is gone. Bernadette threatens to take the matter to the police if necessary.Dugan finally tells Stoney he'll take the run if he gets a certified check for $3,000 in Honolulu. As Dugan explores the plane, Petey, a duck belonging to Julie, one of the orphans, escapes to the back of the plane. Dugan goes after him and ends up dropping out the back. Seeing the plane's condition, Dugan heads off, but stops short when he sees the creditors drive up. Saying he'll fly the cargo run, Dugan asks Stoney to stall them.The kids load the rest of the animals, among them a bull, Brutus. Dugan has trouble getting Brutus on the plane until Bobby, another of the kids, coaxes him on board. Dugan has the kids leave, while Julie and Bobby stay behind to say goodbye to Petey and Brutus, respectively. Evading the creditors, Dugan packs his bags. Bernadette says goodbye to Julie and Bobby and she and Dugan head for the plane. Once on board, Dugan starts the engines. Uneasy about how Dugan will treat the animals, Bobby sneaks on board. Julie follows him.As Dugan takes off, he lights a cigar while Bernadette plays classical music in a tape player. Dugan complains about the music, and Bernadette, who he calls \"Bernie,\" says she'll let stop playing the music if he stops smoking. Dugan reluctantly agrees, then discovers that the plane's autopilot isn't working. Bernie offers to help, but Dugan is doubtful since her experience is limited to a few hours flying a Cessna. As soon as she takes control, however, the plane pitches nose down. Just then, Petey comes out, followed by the kids. Dugan goes back with the kids to check on the animals, but is knocked unconscious when Brutus kicks him.The kids report the problem to Bernie, but just then Dugan returns. He settles in to fly the plane through the rest of the night while the kids sleep in the back. The next morning, Bernie and Dugan see the sunrise off the left wing, not behind them as expected. Dugan checks the instruments, which indicate that they're still on the heading he wanted to fly. When he removes Bernie's tape player, however, he discovers that the player had affected the compass and they're now off course. He says they'll have to go as far as they can before they run out of fuel. Bernie asks if they can turn back, but Dugan says they've gone too far.As the engines begin to flame out, Bobby spots an island off to the left. The engines die out completely just before they reach the island, forcing Dugan to ditch in the water, with the plane coming to a sudden stop on the beach. Dugan and Bernie build a corral out of the vegetation and move the animals from the plane into the corral. Meanwhile, two Japanese sailors, who noticed the plane when it crashed, begin making plans to intercept the new arrivals.As Bobby leads Brutus to the corral, he suddenly runs off. Bobby and Julie chase after him, finally catching up to him near a river. When they make their way back, they see the Japanese sailors' hut and tell Dugan and Bernie. Dugan says the hut must have been a World War II military outpost. Bernie says the sailors look like they're still dressed for the war. Dugan says they may not have heard that it ended. Bernie suggests going down and talking to them, but Dugan vetoes the idea, saying they should go back to the plane instead.Back in the plane, the group sees the two sailors come out. The sailors demand that the group surrender, but both their rifles malfunction and a grenade that one of them throws turns out to be a dud. Dugan, Bernie, Bobby, and Julie chase them back into the underbrush. Bernie says she still wants to make friends with them, but Dugan still doesn't trust them.As Julie and Bobby prepare for bed, Julie says that Dugan was brave, but Bobby says he still doesn't like him. Bernie goes to relieve Dugan, apologizing for her behavior. Dugan also apologizes. Bernie says she'd like for them to try to get along better.The next morning, Bernie is nowhere to be found, so Dugan goes after her while the kids go swimming. Bernie makes her way to the sailors' camp, finding it empty. As she explores their hut, they return. She tells them that World War II is over. They settle down and prepare a meal, which they share with her. Meanwhile, Dugan comes across the compound. When he overhears Bernie saying, \"No more, I've had enough,\" and hears the soldiers laughing, he charges the hut, breaking a wall and upsetting the meal. The soldiers attack Dugan, but Bernie shouts at them to stop. She introduces her friends to Dugan as Commander Hiro and Cleveland from the Japanese Navy. Cleveland, who is fluent in English, says that his mom visited the United States in 1924 and her favorite city was Cleveland, his namesake. Bernie says the sailors have been stranded on the island for 35 years.As Bernie and Dugan make their way back to the plane, he lectures her for leaving. Later that night, while the kids are sleeping, he tries to apologize to her. When she doesn't listen, he asks more forcefully and they go outside to talk. Meanwhile, not having actually fallen asleep, Bobby and Julie sneak to the front of the plane and overhear them talking. Dugan tells Bernie he cares about her and they share a kiss. Bobby asks Julie how Bernie can like Dugan, and she says Dugan is really nice. Bobby remains unconvinced.The next day, the sailors see the group attempting to drag a rubber fuel tank from the plane. Cleveland says the tank will make a lousy raft, and Hiro comes up with an idea to use the plane as a boat. Bobby likes the idea, but Dugan has his doubts. Cleveland asks him if he plans to stay until someone finds him, and he says he will, even if it's a couple of days or weeks. Cleveland then asks him, \"How about 35 years?\"With the sailors' help, Dugan, Bernie, Bobby, and Julie change the plane into a boat. Bernie works on a sail, but when she asks for a large piece of cloth to put in the center, the sailors offer their Japanese flag. Bernie adds the flag at the top.Bobby and Julie start to load the animals, but Dugan says they can't bring them on board. This angers Bobby, who says that Julie kept saying that Dugan was nice, but his refusal to board the animals now proves otherwise. Julie gets upset, and Dugan finally relents, allowing the animals to be loaded. Walking around to the other side of the plane, Dugan sees Bernie painting the name \"Noah's Ark\" on the side and tells her he hates the name \"Noah,\" but says that otherwise the name is fine.As the group prepares to depart the island, they can't find any sign of Cleveland or Hiro. When they can't wait any longer, they launch the boat, but just as they get into the water Cleveland and Hiro appear on the beach. They jump in the water and swim toward the boat. Dugan asks Cleveland and Hiro why they were late. Just then, they see several explosions on the hillside -- following orders they were given during the war, the sailors made sure they left nothing when they departed.The group sails toward Hawaii. As they sail, Bernie gets an idea about sending a message. Dugan ties a note to Petey and sends him off, but the duck heads in the wrong direction. Cleveland suggests they try fishing, but he and Hiro are unable to catch anything. Meanwhile, Brutus refuses to eat. Bobby tries to give him some milk, but Dugan stops him, saying the milk is their food supply and he doesn't want it being used to feed the animals. Annoyed, Bobby takes his milk ration and gives it to Brutus.That night, Bobby gets an idea to use a lantern to draw fish -- something he and a friend would do at the orphanage. The light draws the fish, but it also draws a shark, which scares the fish away. Using the last of their caught fish, Dugan, Hiro, and Cleveland go after the shark, but it gets away. Wanting to get a closer look, Bobby gets too close to the edge, slips, and falls in the water. Dugan jumps in after him and barely manages to get him back on board before the shark returns. As Dugan jumps on board, Bernie fires a gun at the shark, killing it. Bobby thanks Dugan for saving his life, but Dugan berates him, saying he nearly got both of them killed. Dugan orders Cleveland to take Bobby downstairs and get him changed.Below deck, Dugan asks the rest of the group to leave him and Bobby alone. He apologizes to Bobby. Bobby also apologizes for his behavior, and they agree to be friends.The next day, a storm hits, destroying part of the wooden decks on the boat but leaving it otherwise intact. After the storm clears, Brutus, who has fallen down, is lying on his side. Bobby asks if Brutus can be saved, but Bernie says there's nothing that can be done. Dugan pulls out a gun to put Brutus out of his misery, but Bobby refuses to let him be shot. Dugan asks Bobby what his dad would have done. Bobby says his dad left him at the orphanage and didn't care. Dugan says that now Bobby is surrounded by people who *do* care. Hiro takes the gun from Dugan, sits down next to Bobby, and gently talks to him in Japanese. Resigned to Brutus' fate, Bobby says a tearful goodbye to him, then nods to Hiro.As Hiro prepares to shoot Brutus, the group hears a whistle from a Coast Guard cutter, which has located them. As the cutter tows them toward shore, Brutus is shown to have fully recovered, while Dugan marries Bernie and they hug the kids."

          "note: work in progressIn 1949 post-WWII Los Angeles, gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has become the most powerful figure in the California criminal underworld, and intends to continue to expand his criminal enterprise across the Western United States, forcing out his rivals in Chicago. The police have not been able to stop Cohen's ruthless rise, as Cohen has eliminated witnesses and bribed both the courts and the police, controlling both illegal and legal sides of L.A.The movie opens as Cohen has a gangster from Chicago killed by shackling him to two cars, which then proceed to rip him in half. He warns the gangster's partner to return to Chicago with news of what he's seen.The next day, Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) and his partner are at Los Angeles Union Station when they see one of Cohen's thugs, Mitch, approach a young woman and tell her he is holding auditions, and hands her a card to convince her he is legitimate. O'Mara realizes, however, that Mitch intends to rape her. They tail him to a building that is owned by Cohen. O'Mara's partner refuses to enter, forcing O'Mara to go inside by himself.O'Mara enters the building, telling the man that he is meeting someone. He gets on an elevator, accompanied by two thugs. Things go sour, though, when one of them sees his handcuffs and realizes that O'Mara is a cop. A fight breaks out, during which one henchman is killed and another loses his hand. O'Mara finds the room where the girl is being held captive. He bursts in and after a brawl, subdues the three men and rescues the girl.Although the gangsters are arrested, they are set free on a corrupt judge's order, and Cohen subsequently has them killed by locking them up in an elevator and burning down the building.O'Mara is personally selected by Chief Bill Parker (Nick Nolte) due to O'Mara's special operations background and training at Camp X during World War II to wage guerrilla warfare on Cohen, dismantling his crime empire and forcing him out of Los Angeles. With the help of his reluctant and pregnant wife, Connie (Mireille Enos), O'Mara recruits fellow officers in his squad. Initially he is joined by hard-headed detective Coleman Harris (Anthony Mackie), wire-tapper Conway Keeler (Giovanni Ribisi), and legendary gangster-killer Max Kennard (Robert Patrick). Kennard's partner, Navidad Ramirez (Michael Peña), follows the squad and they reluctantly allow him to join. Sgt. Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling), O'Mara's close friend, turns down the offer, as he is disillusioned from the war and his time on the police force.Wooters has been keeping close to his old friend Jack Whalen (Sullivan Stapleton), who is his informant from within Cohen's operations. After meeting for drinks, Wooters becomes infatuated with Cohen's etiquette coach and girlfriend Grace Faraday (Emma Stone). Wooters and Grace begin a secret romantic relationship. After Cohen orders a hit on rival Jack Dragna (Jon Polito) that results in the death of Pete (Austin Abrams), an innocent boy Wooters knew, Wooters becomes motivated to take down Cohen. He saves O'Mara's squad after an unsuccessful hit on one of Cohen's casinos, and later joins them.With organization and better planning the unit strikes several successful blows at the heart of Cohen's criminal organization. The media refer to them as \"The Gangster Squad\". After wire-tapping Cohen's house, Keeler deduces the central location of Cohen's wire gambling business, the heart of his empire. The squad successfully burns down the business, but Cohen's men inform him that they didn't take any of his money. Cohen believes they are a group of honest cops, and believes someone ratted him out and tapped his house. As his men sweep the house for bugs, Grace runs away, fearing Cohen knows of her relationship with Wooters.The Gangster Squad is lured into a trap in Los Angeles's Chinatown by Cohen's head hitman Wrevock (Troy Garity), who was also responsible for Pete's death. Wooters interrupts the ambush just in time to save O'Mara, but Wrevock escapes. Karl Lennox (Holt McCallany), Cohen's right-hand man, kills Keeler in the unit's operation. Wooters asks Whalen to get Grace out of town, but Cohen reaches him first, looking for Grace, and kills him. O'Mara's house is later hit by a drive-by, and Connie gives birth to their son under the stress. Chief Parker tells O'Mara that, as a result of their failure, their careers with the LAPD are over. O'Mara gets Connie out of town, but refuses to leave with the job unfinished. Grace tells Wooters she is willing to testify against Cohen for Whalen's murder, prompting O'Mara, along with the remaining members of his unit, to go to the Park Plaza Hotel to arrest Cohen.Cohen and his men engage in a firefight with the police unit, with Wooters being wounded in the process after killing Wrevock. Cohen and Lennox escape, but O'Mara pursues them, which results in their vehicle crashing into a fountain. Kennard gets shot by Lennox, but manages to kill him with help from Navidad, before dying from his wounds. O'Mara prepares to arrest Cohen, but Cohen tempts him into fighting each other in a bare-knuckle boxing match, while a crowd of onlookers and journalists gather. O'Mara finally beats Cohen and has him arrested, ending his reign as a crime boss and the spread of the mafia into the Los Angeles area. The Gangster Squad was never mentioned in taking down Cohen, their surviving members remaining a secret. Cohen is sentenced to 25 to life, and is welcomed violently by Whalen's friends. Grace and Wooters continue their relationship, while Navidad and Harris become partners on the force. O'Mara quits to live a quiet life with his wife and son"

          "1949 Los Angeles. Boxer turned mobster Mickey Cohen, who had been working in Chicago with some other mobster associates, has moved his operation to Los Angeles. He plans to take control of the city, in the process squeezing out all competition by whatever means, usually by violence. In being able to achieve this, Cohen has many in Los Angeles area authority in his back pocket. LAPD Chief Bill Parker asks Sgt. John O'Mara to assemble and lead an unofficial, off-the-books squad to deal with the Cohen problem. Parker makes this request specifically to O'Mara because of O'Mara's previous handling of some cases associated with Cohen's operations. O'Mara and the squad are not to kill Cohen - which would only lead to someone else taking over - but rather disable all his operations in such a way no other mobster would consider coming in. Although she doesn't much like this assignment, O'Mara's loving and very pregnant wife, Connie, convinces her husband that he needs to recruit others with specialized skills as opposed to clones of himself which was his original thought, her advice all in an effort to make sure he comes home alive as a father at the end of it all. O'Mara will have to control the disparate group he has assembled in working toward their common goal. One issue he will have to deal with is the fact that one of his colleagues, Sgt. Jerry Wooters, who has lost his professional drive, has just embarked on affair with Cohen's girlfriend, Grace Faraday, the two whose lives would be in danger if Cohen ever found out. As O'Mara and his team plow ahead without a clear plan, they may encounter problems in finding out who indeed is in Cohen's back pocket, and as they can't ask for any assistance from anyone outside of the squad as being \"unofficial\". Nonetheless, they may be able to continue progressing to their end goal as long as Cohen does not know who they are, namely that they are LAPD undercover. If they are ever discovered, it may not only compromise their work, but may place their lives, and that of their loved ones, in mortal danger.",

          "*** NOTE: This synopsis applies to the extended \"collector's edition\" version with the expanded battle scene ***Above the skies of London, a Luftwaffe bombardment group flies in, evades the defending flak gunners, and starts to drop yet another load of bombs on that much-abused city. Below, in a modest home in the London suburb of Finchley, a distraught mother rouses her four children from their sleep and hurries them to a bomb shelter, including one, the younger boy, who foolishly stands next to an open window. But just as they are about to enter the shelter, the young boy turns around and runs back into the house, to retrieve a portrait of their father, an RAF pilot. The older brother dashes after the younger one, and the two boys are nearly killed as the younger one recovers the portrait. As they gain the shelter, the older boy, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), explodes at his younger brother Edmund (Skandar Keynes), saying that his rash act almost brought death to them all. \"Why can't you just do as you're told?\" he concludes, indicating that he has been the Man of the House since the elder Pevensie went off to war.The next day, Mrs. Pevensie (Judy McIntosh) herds her four children, Peter, Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund, and Lucy (Georgie Henley), onto an evacuation train at Paddington Station, the London terminus of the Great Western Railway. Mrs. Pevensie lovingly pins identification tags on each one and exhorts the older ones to take care of the younger ones. They all board the train, with Edmund sulkily protesting that he can board a train by himself.The four children ride out of London to a town called Coombe Halt, where the first motorcar they see simply blares its horn at them and moves on, leaving them standing there wondering whether, in Edmund's words, they might have been incorrectly labeled. Just then a horse-drawn cart appears, driven by a severe-looking middle-aged woman whom Peter guesses is the \"Mrs. Macready\" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) whom they were told to expect. Mrs. Macready is housekeeper to Professor Digory Kirke (Jim Broadbent), who lives on a vast estate dominated by a large house containing a wealth of historical artifacts from classical times and the Middle Ages. Macready informs them that the professor \"is unaccustomed to having children in his house,\" and on that account--or perhaps because the house is so like a museum--the children are subject to some rather strict rules. The chief rule (other than \"no touching of the historical artifacts\") is: Do not disturb the Professor.The children's first day on the estate reveals the tensions among the siblings. Edmund Pevensie is, quite simply, a \"rotten kid\", Lucy is homesick, Peter feels the weight of trying to be the Man of the Family while their father is fighting the war, and Susan is constantly \"trying to be smart\" and thus often bumps heads with Peter. (The bulletins describing yet more bombing runs by the Luftwaffe don't help their mood any.) The following day is no better, because it's raining and forces the children to stay indoors. Lucy proposes a game of hide-and-seek, and Peter, hoping to humor her, agrees to be \"It\" and starts counting up to 100. The other children find hiding places (Edmund pushing Lucy out of a closet after declaring that he was there first)--but Lucy finds the strangest hiding place of all--an unused room containing one \"sheeted\" piece of furniture that turns out to be a magnificent wooden armoire, or wardrobe, with an intricate carving of a tree on one of its doors. Lucy climbs inside and burrows in among the coats--but then finds that she can keep going, deeper and deeper, until she emerges into a snow-covered woodland!With little thought of anything but this wondrous land she has discovered, she walks out into the wood, and gazes in wonder at the trees. Strangest of all the objects she sees is a perfectly functioning gas lamppost standing far away from any sort of street. And then she sees an even stranger sight: a creature, half man and half goat, carrying an armload of brown-wrapped parcels and holding a flimsy parasol over his head!This creature and Lucy both cry out and hide from one another, and then come out and start a conversation--tentative at first, and then more confident. The faun, who gives his name as Tumnus (James McAvoy), is delighted to learn that Lucy is a \"daughter of Eve,\" i.e. human. He won't tell her why her human origin is so important, but he rather strenuously persuades her to join him at his home for tea and crumpets--\"and perhaps I'll even break into the sardines.\"Lucy questions nothing that she sees, even the idea that such a creature could not only exist, but also be civilized enough to have a furnished home--with a library of leather-bound books carrying such titles as \"Humans\" and \"Is Man a Myth?\". Tumnus then reveals that the world they are in, called Narnia, has seen no Christmas, and no season except winter, for the last hundred years. Then he offers to play some music of the sort that he used to play in Narnia's summers. He plays a hypnotic tune on a flute-like instrument, and Lucy actually sees shapes form in the flames of Tumnus' hearth fire, shapes of a man riding a unicorn, and fauns and dryads dancing. Eventually Lucy drops her teacup and falls asleep--and then another shape entirely forms in the flames: an angry lion who roars at Tumnus, stopping his playing and snuffing out the candles in his home.Now Tumnus makes a terrible confession: the ruling tyrant of his world, whom he calls the White Witch, has given orders that if any of her subjects were to find a human or humans wandering in the woods, they were to turn said human(s) over to her. Tumnus was trying to lull Lucy to sleep and hand her over--but now, conscience-stricken, he decides instead to hurry her back to the lamppost so that she can return to \"the shining city of War Drobe in the wondrous land of Spare Oom.\" As a token of her friendship, Lucy gives Tumnus her handkerchief before they part.Lucy tumbles out of the wardrobe--but to her surprise, Peter is just finishing his \"It\" count and saying, \"Ready or not, here I come!\" As a result, Lucy loses immediately when she cries out that she is all right after all, and cannot make her brothers and sister believe that she's been gone for hours. Especially when Susan investigates the wardrobe and finds nothing but a solid wooden wall where Lucy had claimed to find a wooded country. Peter, however, has another problem: Edmund makes a stupid joke about finding \"the football field in the bathroom cupboard,\" and when Peter severely reprimands Edmund for \"having to make things worse,\" Edmund cries out that Peter tries to pretend that he's their father, which Edmund will never accept.Later that night, Lucy takes her candle and goes into the spare room again. And when she opens the door to the wardrobe, a cold breeze blows out the candle. So Lucy goes into the wardrobe and into the wood. But behind her is Edmund, thinking to catch Lucy and make fun of her. And so he is quite unprepared to find himself entering the winter forest himself.Edmund at first searches for Lucy (and never thinks to follow her footprints). Then he is nearly run over by a sleigh drawn by six large white reindeer stags, and driven by an angry dwarf named Ginarrbrik (Kiran Shah), who stops the sleigh, dismounts, catches Edmund, and is about to cut his throat when the sleigh's passenger calls out, \"Wait.\" The passenger then dismounts.This is a very tall and very stunning but unusually pale-complexioned woman (Tilda Swinton) with blonde hair arranged in dreadlocks. (With that hairstyle, she may or may not be consciously imitating Medusa, the mythical creature that could petrify anyone foolish enough to look her in the face.) She regards Edmund at first with stern aspect and considers him a trespasser. But when she learns that he is one of four siblings, her attitude changes. She smiles, beguilingly, and offers him a seat in her sleigh--but as she turns aside, one can clearly see that she is worried.The woman offers him a hot drink--which she \"makes\" by dropping a green liqueur onto the snow. She asks him what he would like to eat, and he names his favorite confection: Turkish Delight, which usually is a fruit-flavored sugar snack covered with confectioner's sugar. But the Turkish Delight that this woman conjures up is more than usually addictive. The woman identifies herself as the Queen of Narnia, and then says that she has no children of her own, and could see Edmund becoming Narnia's king some day--but he would have to bring his family to claim that honor. With more beguiling words, she leaves Edmund in the path while her sleigh drives off.Then Lucy appears, and says that she has seen Tumnus again, and that \"the White Witch\" knew nothing of her presence there. Lucy then explains what she meant by that phrase: the \"White Witch\" is a woman who pretends to be the Queen of Narnia, but isn't actually. Edmund is troubled at those words, but won't tell Lucy why.The two children go back through the portal into the wardrobe, and Lucy wakes Peter and Susan to tell them excitedly that \"Narnia\" is all in the wardrobe as she said, and this time Edmund had seen it. But to her horror, Edmund now says that he was just playing along. Lucy starts to cry and runs out. Peter shoves his brother aside and follows Lucy--only to find that she has run into Professor Kirke. The commotion has also roused Mrs. Macready, who is about to send them to sleep in the stables until the Professor assures her that he is not offended, and that Macready could help by serving Lucy some hot chocolate.Professor Kirke questions Peter and Susan about the commotion--and when he hears that Lucy claims to have found a forest in the upstairs wardrobe, the Professor eagerly asks about that forest. Peter, surprised, asks Kirke whether he believes her story--and the professor says that he has no reason not to, and neither should Peter and Susan. \"You're her family!\" he says. \"You might start acting like one!\"The next day is a bright sunny day, so Peter organizes a cricket match--and of course Edmund gets hit with the ball, because he won't pay attention. Then Peter \"bowls\" the ball again, and Edmund swings his bat and connects--and send the ball flying through a stained-glass window, where it smashes a hole and then knocks something over with a crash. The children dash into the house and up the stairs to see what made the crash--and discover a suit of armor knocked supine. \"Well done, Ed!\" says Peter--and then they hear Macready's voice and start to flee. The only place to flee is into the spare room, where, at Edmund's urging, they climb into the wardrobe. And then, in an effort to find more room to crowd in, the children walk back--and-back--and back--until the four of them are in the winter-bound woodland.Peter is abashed and apologizes to Lucy, who starts a good-natured snowball fight. Then he realizes that Edmund has lied to the rest of them about what he had seen, and orders him to apologize, which he does. Then the four, wearing oversized coats taken from the wardrobe, set off for Tumnus' house, at Lucy's suggestion. Even Susan is captivated by this wondrous land--but Edmund is half guilty, half furtive, and constantly looking toward the two mountain peaks that the \"Queen of Narnia\" had pointed out to him on his last visit. No one takes any notice.Finally, they arrive at Tumnus' house--and find it a total wreck, with smashed furniture and crockery, piles of blown-in snow, and a crudely lettered parchment containing a notice accusing Tumnus of \"high treason against Her Majesty, Jadis, Queen of Narnia\" for \"fraternizing with humans.\" It is signed with the paw-print of a wolf, and the name Maugrim, identified as \"captain of the secret police.\" Susan wants them to return home, but Lucy insists on staying, to try to help Tumnus.Just then a small robin gives them an unmistakeable signal to follow, and leads them out into the open, where they meet a beaver (Ray Winstone) who can actually talk to them. The beaver gives Lucy back her handkerchief, says that Tumnus gave it to him just before his arrest, and encourages them all to follow him \"further in,\" and not to talk anymore until they are out of the woods--because some of the trees might actually inform the Witch against them. The beaver leads them all to his house, which he has built in a dam in the frozen river. The beaver has a wife (Dawn French), who acts like a typical good-natured scold--until she sees the four Pevensie children, and bows in obeisance to them as if they are somehow important and deserving of a high honor, which puzzles the children. The only sour note is that the beaver notices that Edmund is \"enjoying the scenery\"--specifically the same two mountain peaks that he was earlier gazing at.Once inside, the beavers tell the children about someone named \"Aslan\" who is \"on the move,\" and waiting for the children at a place called the Stone Table. (The children don't recognize that name, but they all somehow feel that that's a name laden with spiritual significance--all but Edmund, who asks \"Who's Aslan?\" and provokes the beaver to uproarious laughter.) The reason is that a long-standing prophecy says that two \"sons of Adam\" and two \"daughters of Eve\" will fight the White Witch and defeat her in combat, thus ending the winter and her regime. The beavers shock them further by saying that \"Aslan\" has outfitted an army for them to lead! Peter thanks them for their hospitality and prepares to lead the four of them out--but then finds that Edmund has gone missing.Edmund has indeed left the beavers' house and gone hiking toward those two mountain peaks. The others try to follow, but arrive only in time to see Edmund entering a very large, forbidding palace, seemingly constructed of ice and stone. Peter tries to follow, but the male beaver stops him, saying that Edmund is the bait for a trap. When the palace doors close on Edmund, Susan and Peter argue whether they should have gone back long before that, but Lucy says that arguing will not help Edmund. The male beaver agrees, saying, \"Only Aslan can help your brother now\"--so Peter asks the beavers to lead them to Aslan.Edmund, in the palace, is in a courtyard seemingly full of stone-masonry statuary--giants and centaurs and leopards and all manner of other creatures. Whether he notices that all of the statutes seemed to have been carved in an attitude of fright or anger or defiance--as if some of them were trying to kill someone in combat, and others were begging for mercy--is not entirely clear. Then he tries to step over a sleeping wolf (Michael Madsen)--who rouses himself with great speed and pounces on Edmund, challenging him for identification. Edmund says who he is, and the wolf condescendingly leads Edmund to an obvious throne room--where Edmund cannot resist sitting on the throne. Queen Jadis finds him sitting in it, and at first does not reprimand him for such lese-majeste. Instead, she first asks whether his sisters are deaf, and whether his brother is unintelligent--and then loudly demands to know how he dares return alone! Now sounding not very beguiling at all, but talking clearly for the first time, she frightens him into revealing that his brother and sisters are in the beavers' house. Edmund then asks whether he could have more Turkish Delight--and Jadis summons Ginarrbrik, who leads Edmund away at knife point--to a prison cell. Then she summons the wolf, who is actually Maugrim, the police captain--or rather, the alpha dog of a pack of wolves, who now rush out of the palace, intending to raid the beavers' house.At the house, the beavers hurriedly pack some supplies, and then the three children and two beavers escape into a tunnel just as Maugrim and his pack invade the house. The five emerge into another clearing--where they find the stone statue of a badger, which the two beavers recognize as once a buddy of the male beaver's. The children realize at once that they are looking at a real badger, once able to talk as the beavers are but now petrified. Nor is he the only such sad creature whom they find.\"This is what becomes of those who cross the Witch,\" says a fox (Rupert Everett) who offers to hide them up a tree while he sends Maugrim and his pack off on a fool's errand--though the fox is not entirely unscathed in the encounter. After the wolf pack runs away, following the fox's false lead, the fox allows the female beaver to tend to him only briefly, while he informs the party that \"Aslan himself\" has asked him to go about recruiting more troops. Peter is still dubious about getting involved in any war, but the fox and the beavers all urge him to fight, saying, \"We can't go to war without you.\"Back at Jadis' palace, Edmund, chained to the wall of a cell, meets a miserable faun who can only be Tumnus, with whom he shares the unappetizing food that Ginarrbrik, presumably, has thrown him. Tumnus asks Edmund whether Lucy is safe, which Edmund does not know. Then an angry Jadis storms in, saying that her police have torn the beaver house apart and found nothing. Lifting Edmund off his feet, she glares at him angrily--and if she didn't look like Medusa at their first meeting, she definitely does now. She demands to know where they went and is on the point of striking him with her upraised sceptre when Edmund abruptly drops the name of \"Aslan.\" Tumnus is shocked to hear him reveal so much, and Edmund, not wanting to reveal too much too fast, says that he left before his siblings said where they were going. Jadis then cruelly informs Tumnus, \"You're here because he turned you in for sweeties!\" She orders Tumnus taken to the statuary courtyard, and her sleigh made ready for travel. When Edmund is led out to the sleigh, he passes a statue of Tumnus--which he now realizes, with a sickening feeling in his gut, is actually Tumnus--petrified. That must have almost happened to Edmund, and worse yet: every one of those statues is not a statue at all, but a petrified victim of the Queen of Narnia--and \"White Witch\" is certainly a name that fits! And he is her prisoner.Jadis sets out on her sleigh (without bells), with Edmund bound hand and foot and sitting miserably at her feet. Meanwhile, the beavers lead the remaining Pevensies over a natural stone bridge to a vast vista that they will have to cross. Reluctantly, Peter leads the party across the apparent frozen wasteland, with the beavers acting as their only guides. On the way, a sleigh notices them and gives chase, forcing them to hide. The fleeing children fail to notice that the sleigh has a full set of bells on--or else don't stop to think that Jadis would not have hung bells on her sleigh while on the hunt. In any case, the driver of the sleigh that pursues the children is not Queen Jadis, or the nasty Ginarrbrik--but none other than Father Christmas (James Cosmo)!\"I've been driving one of these longer than the Witch,\" he says by way of explanation, and then gives the children some valuable gifts. To Lucy he gives a bottle made of diamond and containing a bright-red-colored cordial made from \"fire-flower juice,\" one drop of which can heal any injury, and a small dagger. To Susan he gives a bow, an ivory quiver filled with bright red-feathered arrows, and an ivory horn that will summon aid from anywhere. To Peter he gives a shield (argent a lion rampant guardant erect gules) and a sword containing a runic message that he does not take the time to translate. Then he says, \"Winter's almost over, and things do pile up when you've been away for a hundred years! Long live Aslan, and Merry Christmas!\"Peter notices another implication of Father Christmas' message: the great river that they must cross, that is supposed to be frozen, will not be frozen much longer. Sure enough, when they arrive at the Ford of Beruna, the river is already thawing. Desperately the children and the beavers try to cross on what little ice remains--and then Maugrim and his pack catch up with them. Maugrim's beta, or second-in-command, pounces on the male beaver while Maugrim taunts Peter and Susan, saying, \"This isn't your war! All my Queen wants is for you to leave!\" Maugrim might or might not have noticed that the rest of his pack are no longer able to support him, because the ice, breaking up, is already carrying them downriver and away from the fight. Then, before Peter can make up his mind, the nearby waterfall thaws the rest of the way, and its ice covering breaks. Peter drives his drawn sword into the ice and orders them all to hold on to him--and then the ice-dam collapses, scattering the wolves and washing the five fugitives down river. Almost by a miracle, they survive and manage to get safely across--where they notice that they can shed their coats, for now the snow is melting fast, and the nearby trees are putting out their first buds and leaves of spring.Behind them, Jadis arrives to find a running waterfall--and Maugrim and his pack arrive, dragging the fox who had deceived them earlier. Edmund, hoping to spare the fox's life, reveals the phrase \"stone table\" and that \"Aslan,\" whom he still does not know (though Jadis does) has an \"army.\" To his horror, Jadis strikes the fox with her sceptre--and a horrid blue electric flame leaps from the sceptre, washes over the fox--and petrifies him. That, then, is how she must have killed all those unfortunates in the courtyard! Jadis then slaps Edmund, telling him to remember whose side he is on. Then she orders Maugrim to muster those creatures faithful to her at an undetermined place, and declares--while petrifying an inoffensive butterfly with her sceptre, almost as an afterthought-- \"If it's a war Aslan wants, it's a war he shall get!\"The beavers lead the children straight into a medieval war camp, complete with brightly colored officers' tents, and all manner of wondrous creatures preparing armor and weapons for themselves. The fascinated children see centaurs, more fauns, satyrs, and gryphons (a kind of flying creature, part avian, part mammalian). Susan wonders what everyone is staring at, and Lucy says, \"They probably think *you* look funny!\" But the point is that the onlookers are not looking at the children with curiosity, but with reverence and awe, of a kind reserved for kings and queens. The children still do not understand the significance of this attitude.Peter walks up to the obvious command tent, draws his sword, and says, \"We have come to see Aslan!\" Then everyone kneels to the ground, and the command tent flap opens--and now the children meet Aslan (Liam Neeson) face to face. Aslan is a very large lion, who truly walks like the \"king of beasts,\" and now the children, too, kneel before him, as seems a perfectly natural thing to do. Aslan bids the three welcome, thanks the beavers for their good guidance, and then asks after Edmund--and Peter shocks the assembly by saying that Edmund was captured. The beaver shocks them further by saying that Edmund had betrayed them. Aslan quiets the assembly, and then Peter confesses that he is at least partly to blame, for being \"too hard\" on Edmund. As may be, Edmund is their brother, and they want him back, on any terms--a thing with which Aslan sympathizes, though he warns them that the situation is now very difficult.Later, Peter, now dressed in the leather jerkin of a Medieval officer, talks frankly with Aslan about the battle to come, and about Peter's future career as High King of Narnia, a post that he will have to win in combat. While he and Aslan are talking, Edmund is in a truly miserable situation: bound and gagged, and being taunted by Ginarrbrik about his \"special treatment.\"Susan and Lucy try on their own new costumes--when suddenly Maugrim appears, with only his beta to accompany him. (Why he did not come with his whole pack is never explained.) They announce that they intend to kill them both. Susan throws one of her dresses into Maugrim's face, grabs her horn, and manages to get off a good blast before she and Lucy have to climb a tree. Peter rushes to the spot and finds the girls up a tree with Maugrim and his beta trying to jump at them. Maugrim turns to Peter, saying, \"We both know you haven't got it in you!\" Peter is wondering how he will fight two wolves at once when suddenly Aslan arrives and restrains the beta. Behind Aslan come several galloping centaurs, led by Oreius (Patrick Kake), who draws his sword. Aslan tells them to stay where they are and let Peter fight his battle. Maugrim charges Peter--and impales himself on Peter's sword. Aslan releases the beta dog, sends Oreius and the centaurs to chase him, and holds a dubbing ceremony to invest Peter with a new title: Sir Peter Wolf's-bane, Knight of Narnia.Later that night, Oreius, having followed Maugrim's miserable beta back to Jadis' camp, leads a successful raid to rescue Edmund. The next morning, Aslan talks to Edmund alone about what he has done, and then re-introduces Edmund to his siblings, telling them \"there is no need to speak about what is past.\" Peter and his sisters are glad enough to have Edmund back, and are quite satisfied that Aslan has asked all the questions that need asking.The four children then have a serious conference. Peter wants to send his three siblings back to the lamppost and the wardrobe, while he stays and leads Aslan's troops in the coming battle. But Lucy insists that the free Narnians need all four of them to win, and Edmund will not walk away from a situation that he helped create. Susan, the last holdout, then takes up her bow and arrows to \"get in some practice.\" All four of them practice their combat techniques--Susan with her bow and arrow, Lucy with her dagger, and Peter and Edmund learning the proper way to ride a horse while holding a drawn sword (\"Sword point up!\") and even how to fight while on horseback. Then the male beaver alerts them all that Jadis has demanded a parley with Aslan and is coming to the camp.Jadis makes a terrible demand: Edmund must surrender himself to her, to be executed on the Stone Table--otherwise, Narnia will be destroyed completely. Aslan offers to talk alone with Jadis. Later, Jadis and Aslan emerge from the command tent, and Aslan announces that Jadis has renounced her claim. Jadis wants to know whether Aslan's own \"promise\" will be kept. Aslan roars his answer at her, and Jadis leaves--but Lucy notices that Aslan is much troubled.That night, Aslan walks out of his camp, toward the Stone Table. Susan and Lucy plead with Aslan to let them accompany him, a gesture that Aslan appreciates. But finally Aslan orders them to wait and \"trust\" him--while he walks into a barbaric ceremony and submits to being bound, shorn, and eventually executed with a single stroke of a stone knife held by Jadis.Jadis orders her own chief general, a minotaur named Otmin (Shane Rangi), to prepare for battle, \"however short it may be.\" Her forces withdraw, leaving Aslan's body alone on the Stone Table. Susan and Lucy rush forward and stand guard over the body all night long. Lucy opens her bottle of fire-flower cordial, but Susan says that it is too late for that, because Aslan is dead. (The cordial is a potion, and Aslan can no longer swallow it.) Susan at first wants to chase away the rats and mice who are swarming around Aslan, until Lucy points out that they are actually gnawing away his bonds. Then Susan says that Peter and Edmund need to be alerted, and Lucy reminds her that the trees are animated--or rather, have their own spirits, the dryads, who can carry messages faster than even the girls can deliver them. And so a dryad (Katrina Browne) awakens Peter and Edmund, back at the main camp, to advise them of Aslan's death.Now Edmund turns to Peter and says that Peter must lead them. Peter is afraid that he would never be able to do this--but Edmund reminds him that Aslan believed in him--and now, so does Edmund himself. Oreius, as if to underline the point, asks Peter what his orders are--and Peter gives them.The next day, the First Battle of Beruna unfolds. Peter deploys a cavalry consisting of centaurs and leopards at the base of a cliff, and orders Edmund to command the rest of his forces, armed with bows and arrows, at the top of the cliff. Peter even has an air force, consisting of talking eagles, falcons, hawks, and gryphons. He designates some to act as fighters, some as bombers, and some as aerial scouts.One gryphon (Cameron Rhodes) brings word that the enemy forces are coming, \"in numbers and weapons far greater than our own.\" Oreius confidently observes that numbers alone are not sufficient to win.The battle starts when Otmin leads half of Jadis' forces onto the open area, advancing in a full horizontal line. Peter first orders aerial bombardment, by his gryphons and other birds, carrying rocks and dropping them onto the advancing black dwarfs, ankle slicers, and other unsavory creatures. Otmin notices the approaching gryphons and alerts his forces, who begin shooting arrows. Jadis, driving a chariot drawn by polar bears, sends a group of large bats to attack the gryphons, resulting in a rather interesting substitute for modern aerial dogfighting.Then Peter cries out, \"For Narnia and for Aslan!\" and, astride his own war charger (a white unicorn), leads his cavalry in flying-wedge formation to drive into the enemy line.At the Stone Table, the girls prepare to leave--when suddenly they are thrown off their feet, as the Stone Table cracks in two--and Aslan is now missing. Then, as the look, a very much alive Aslan appears before them, assuring them that he had relied on a little-understood provision of the \"Deep Magic,\" \"that when a willing victim who has committed no treachery dies in a traitor's stead, the Stone Table will crack, and death itself will turn backwards.\" Aslan then orders the girls to climb on his back and cover their ears, as he starts to race across the countryside--back to Jadis' castle.At the battle, Peter orders Edmund to deploy another weapon--a phoenix, that forms out of a firebrand shot like an arrow from the top of the cliff. Jadis sends a bat after it, but Peter kills the bat with a javelin. The phoenix then self-combusts and draws a wall of fire separating the two sides--until Jadis advances and uses her magic--perhaps a blast of energy from her sceptre--to part the wall. Peter now orders his forces to fall back to the rocks inside the cliff area, where Edmund and his archers will shoot the enemy as they try to come in.All goes well, until Ginarrbrik shoots Peter's war charger out from under him. Now unhorsed, Peter watches helplessly as Oreius charges forward to attack Jadis on his own. Otmin tries to stop Oreius, but the centaur leader impales him with his swords. Drawing another, massive sword, Oreius leaps at Jadis, but the White Witch easily leans back to dodge his blow--and in the process, Oreius gets too close, thus allowing Jadis to petrify him with one touch of her sceptre.At that instant, Aslan, Susan, and Lucy have arrived at Jadis' palace, which is totally unguarded. Lucy sees the petrified Tumnus and bursts into tears--but then Aslan breathes upon Tumnus and revives him! Aslan orders the girls to search the palace, saying that they must form a relief army out of every petrified creature they can find.Jadis, having petrified Oreius, fends off all attackers with the same deadly efficacy. Peter now orders Edmund to quit the field, find the girls, and get them home. At first Edmund allows the male beaver to drag him away--but then he notices Jadis making her way to Peter and raising her sword and that dreadful sceptre. Once again he disobeys: he jumps into the fray, knocking Ginarrbrik off a cliff in the process, and engages Jadis as she is about to use the sceptre. Edmund swings his own sword, forcing Jadis to withdraw the sceptre. Jadis then thrusts forward with the sceptre in an attack on Edmund, but Edmund backsteps in time--and with another two-handed swing of his sword, cuts the sceptre in two, thus permanently deactivating it in a wash of blue lightning. The display distracts Edmund for a critical few seconds--and Jadis, who is much more skilled than Edmund, disarms him with the sword she is carrying in her left hand, and stabs him with the short fragment of her broken sceptre.Peter, seeing this, cries out in blind rage and rushes at Jadis, swatting another minotaur aside like an annoying insect. Then the two leaders clash, with Peter, armed with sword and shield, against Jadis, who has cast aside her now-useless sceptre and engages him with two swords--her own and the one that Edmund had been carrying. Peter swings almost blindly, Jadis counters every move he makes, and their differences in skill are painfully obvious--and then a great, air-filling roar interrupts them both, and they turn to see Aslan, the last person whom Jadis ever expected to see--with Susan and Lucy, at the head of a force greater even than the force that Peter had started out with!Susan and Lucy's relief forces, with Tumnus and a good-natured giant (Lee Tuson) in the lead, rush in and start to make quick work of Jadis' forces. Jadis, now concentrating on Peter, trips him up, pins his sword arm with one of her own swords, lifts his shield away from him, and is about to finish Peter off with one quick thrust when the angry Aslan pounces and bowls her over. Aslan allows her about five seconds of respite--during which she looks at Aslan with a look that is half terrified and half anticipatory. Then Aslan opens his great jaws and presumably breaks her neck. Whereupon Jadis' troops break and run in a rout, with Susan and Lucy's relief forces in hot pursuit. (The pursuit is made to look like an army of wraiths, to illustrate that Peter can barely perceive them, and has eyes only for Aslan and the dead Jadis.) As the chase moves out into the open, Aslan quietly declares, \"It is finished.\"Peter is joyously reunited with his sisters, and then reveals that Edmund is very badly wounded. The three come upon him, breathing agonally, with Ginarrbrik about to cut his head off. Susan kills Ginarrbrik with her bow, and then Lucy gives Edmund a drop of the firewater juice--which at first does not appear to succeed, until Edmund regains his consciousness and breathing. Peter embraces his brother lovingly, and then asks, \"When are you going to learn to do as you're told?\"Aslan then starts reviving the petrified Narnians by breathing on them (Aslan can restore anyone from that state, even a petrified creature that has since been shattered), and Lucy rushes about with her bottle of firewater juice to render what first aid she can. The shot then slews over the countryside, all the way out to the mouth of the Great River, to Cair Paravel, the Castle of the Four Thrones, where a solemn coronation ceremony now takes place. Aslan presides, of course, and installs the four children as the permanent resident Kings and Queens of Narnia, each with his or her own region of responsiblity. With that done, Aslan walks out along the beach and away from Narnia, obviously leaving the children in charge. Tumnus assures Lucy that Aslan will return one day, but when Aslan himself sees fit.Years later, the four Kings and Queens, now grown to adulthood, are in the Western Wood, chasing after the legendary White Stag, when they happen upon a most strange device: a lamp growing out of the ground. The four know it is familiar, but don't know why--until Lucy (Rachael Henley) remembers a phrase, \"Spare Oom!\" and leads the other three (Noah Huntley, Sophie Winkleman, and Mark Wells) deeper into the woods. As they continue to run, they find themselves in a confined space--with coats, not trees, to either side--and in the next instant they pile out of the original wardrobe, having not aged a day or even a second since entering Narnia so many years, as they perceived them, before--and then Professor Kirke comes to ask them what they were all doing in the wardrobe!\"You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir!\" says Peter, now back to his original age, as are all the others. Kirke tosses him the cricket ball he had bowled, and says, \"Try me.\"As the credits roll, Lucy tries one more time to re-enter Narnia through the wardrobe, and Kirke informs her that she will not likely be able to re-enter that way, because \"you see, I have already tried.\" This is the one time that Professor Kirke reveals that he knows far more about Narnia than he ever was willing to tell, and even that the children can expect to return to Narnia someday, but at a time when they least expect, and aren't actively looking for it. As he leads Lucy out of the spare room, Aslan gives one last roar through the open wardrobe, which then turns dark forever."

          "Alan Lloyd (Terence Hill) is an inveterate gambler who accumulates a lot of debt and therefore is forced to flee, pursued by shady employers in the area. Charlie O'Brien (Bud Spencer) is an actor who is hired to advertise a jam (that tastes horrible) and is embarking on a long promotional boat trip. Alan, still fleeing, hides inside Charlie's boat behind his back.After Alan is discovered, the two get into a fight and fall out of the boat, eventually reaching a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. There, the two initially believe they are on a deserted island, but then discover that it is inhabited and familiarize themselves with the natives who are under the command of an elderly woman named Mama.The welcome party is interrupted by a group of leather-clad homosexual pirates who come each year to capture some natives to sell them as slaves, but they do not know that Alan and Charlie are there now. After a lot of punches and blows the gay pirates are expelled and flee from the island in their sailboat.Alan, Charlie and the natives celebrate and make peace with an old Japanese general in a fort on the island who still believes that World War II is not over. The man receives Alan and Charlie in his bunker and shows them a huge amount of money (stolen from the American navy during the war) that he kept hidden for years. Charlie is crazy with joy and secretly steals all the money, while the Japanese confides to Alan that the money is all fake.Charlie plans to leave with an old plane but the gay pirates inadvertently come back to the island more aggressive and with the incursion of a group of criminals who had the honor to clash with Alan at the beginning of the story. The natives are captured and humiliated, so Alan and Charlie, who had gone off (without the latter having discovered the secret of fake money), come back, swoop down with the plane on the attackers and fight their enemies in a battle to the sound of blows and punches, finally defeating them and bringing lasting peace to the island.Finally Alan and Charlie are rescued by the crew of USS Forrestal. They give the fake money to the navy, only to be told that it is real (the government spread the tale the money was fake to prevent the Japanese from spending it). They get hailed as heroes but end up without any money and a hand-made idol (a gift from the grateful natives for Alan and Charlie) ends up donated to a museum.In the final scene, we see the idol in a museum with a card saying that it is worth a fortune and Alan and Charlie are seen working as janitors at the museum and planning to steal it."

For a young boy, this time in history was more of an adventure, a total upheaval of order, restrictions and discipline. The liberating effect of the war on the women left behind.

          "Bill Rohan, a young boy living on the outskirts of London experiences the exhilaration of World War II, as seen through the eyes of director John Boorman, who also wrote and produced the autobiographical film. During this period, Bill learns about sex, death, love, hypocrisy, and the faults of adults as he prowls the ruins of bombed houses on Rosehill Avenue. His childlike father is off chasing patriotic dreams of glory from behind a military clerk's typewriter; his teenage sister runs wild; his mother can't cope; and everything in the end will eventually turn out all right.",
          "Now on the far side of middle age, Bill Rowan remembers back to his growing up period in suburban London during WWII, he ten years old when the war broke out. Beyond his father Clive enlisting and what his absence meant, Bill saw the war as an adventure, the specific events more anticlimactic for him compared to the fear driven into the populace of what could happen. Even with the nightly German air raids and bombs actually dropped in their neighborhood, he saw the bomb sites as a playground from which to collect shrapnel and with his newfound friends to destroy whatever survived the bombs. While his younger sister Susie was too young to comprehend fully what the war meant, his mid-teen sister Dawn went on as a teenage girl with raging hormones is apt to focus on, namely boys, or in wartime young men of the military variety, she often feigning the option of death compared to not being with someone, most specifically a Canadian soldier training nearby. And while Bill's mother Grace was ill-prepared emotionally to be without Clive, she had to grow up quickly to deal with leading the family through the changing times. With Dawn, Grace could see her own teen period a bit more clearly due to the war and what she would have done differently if she had to do it all over again.",
          "Bill is your average young boy, living in London with his parents and two sisters. His should be a conventional childhood but it is September 1939 and the UK is at war with Germany. In the next few years Bill will grow up with the fear and devastation of war, but also some fond memories."

          "In 1951 England, Lynda Mansell is a sixteen-year-old girl living in a small seaside town with her younger sister and widowed father. Lynda's outspoken and feisty nature (her favorite insults are \"Up your bum!\" and \"Cock off!\") make her a constant source of worry and dismay for her father Hubert. Bored and restless, she partakes in exhibitionistic behavior such as bicycling at the boardwalk with her skirt hiked up and other ruckus-causing mischief.Flashbacks to Lynda's younger years show Lynda has had a vulgar tongue since she was an eleven-year-old, with her father disciplining her for using inappropriate language in front of guests at home. It is clear Lynda was very close with her mom and has not recovered from her mother's untimely death.Lynda trains to be a hairdresser like her barber dad, but ends up messing up a volunteer model's hair. She then takes on another job at a bus station, but is fired from that too. Hubert takes Lynda to see a psychiatrist, who tells Hubert something bad clearly happened to Lynda as a child. One day on the boardwalk, Lynda asks a boy, Brian, if he'd like to go to the movies with her. However, their date is awkward and Lynda realizes she is not interested in Brian. Another of Lynda's admirers and a conductor at the bus station, Dave, takes her out dancing and back to his grandmother's vacant house. The sexually naïve Lynda agrees to have sex with him, though the experience is comically shorter than she anticipated.Eric, a projectionist at the movie theater and a friend of her father's, constantly leers at Lynda whenever he sees her. When visiting the Mansell home one day, he flirts with her and puts his hand up her dress when her father isn't in the room. Her father, unaware of what transpired, jokes that Eric could make him an offer for his daughter, to which Eric laughs with the response \"half a dollar\"-an exchange Lynda witnesses. On his way out, Eric makes another pass at Lynda, but she angrily rebuffs him. Lynda later sees Eric hanging around outside her house's gate at night, but she avoids him. While working on a new job at a fish and chip shop, Dave shows up as a customer. However, Dave is accompanied with a new lady friend, angering Lynda.One evening, Lynda hears her father is entertaining Maisie Mathews, a woman Lynda dislikes, at home. Disgusted, Lynda goes out to the front yard where Eric is quietly waiting, and she tentatively responds to Eric's advances. In order to get Lynda to sleep with him, Eric manipulates Lynda's insecurities about being unwanted and unloved by her father. Lynda gives in, with Eric declining to use protection. Hubert catches Lynda when she is sneaking back from a tryst, and, aware of who she was with, tells her how ashamed he is of her, and how her mother would be too if she were still alive. After this Lynda decides to leave home, and, taking some of her mother's old clothes, goes to stay at Eric's loft above the movie theater. Lynda asks if Eric could just cuddle her, but Eric only values her for sex.The film jumps ahead a few months. Lynda now works as a waitress at a tea house. Eric shows up at the café one day even though he and Lynda are no longer a couple. Refusing to serve him, Lynda sends in another waitress, her friend Vickie, in her place. Lynda and Vickie have a laugh at this as they get off work, but Eric is waiting for Lynda outside. Eric continues to follow Lynda and Vickie despite Lynda yelling she is uninterested in a relationship. When Eric claims he misses her, Lynda reveals she is pregnant. Eric's demands for proof prompts Lynda to angrily expose her belly to show she is three months along. Eric expresses doubt the baby is his, resulting in a tussle on the pier.Vickie takes Lynda to a woman who performs illegal abortions, but Lynda says she doesn't have the money to pay and doesn't go inside. Hearing of his estranged daughter's pregnancy, Hubert shows up to the café, insisting Lynda speak to him. Hubert calls Lynda a slut and other insults. Instead of engaging with Hubert, Lynda keeps her distance and condescends back to him. Their back-and-forth turns into a public spat as the other patrons look on. While Hubert rants about how troublesome Lynda's always been and how he plans to disown her, Lynda gets up on a table and rants about stuffy middle-class attitudes towards sex. Lynda is promptly fired from her waitress job, despite applause from the grand dame of the tea room piano.Lynda meets with her Aunt Millie, who tries to persuade Lynda into getting an abortion or to give the baby up for adoption, as women who have children out of wedlock are looked down upon in society. Aunt Millie tells Lynda that the choice is ultimately hers, but leaves her some money to cover an abortion. Lynda returns to the abortionist but hesitates at the doorstep.An epilogue takes place several months later. Lynda is visiting home with her newborn baby. She passes by all the places she used to frequent, including the boardwalk where she used to flash her legs at the boys. Townspeople and former acquaintances are stunned to see her proudly pushing her baby in a pram in public. She makes her way through the bowling greens, past a clearly uncomfortable Eric, defiantly declaring \"Yeah, it's mine! All mine.\" The film ends with Lynda ringing the doorbell to Hubert's home and embracing her baby."

          "The movie opens as the Allies discover the bloody remains of the Malmedy Massacre. We soon learn how the Germans attacked the unarmed prisoners, killing most of them. Several of the soldiers escape and hide out in a bombed-out house. There's \"Deacon\" (Allred) the ex-missionary who is haunted by something from his past that prevents him from sleeping for days at a time. He's also a crack rifleman. Joining him in escaping are Gould (Polinsky), the medic and a boy from Brooklyn, who seems suspicious of everyone, \"Shirl\" (Bagby) a tough soldier from Louisiana with a lust for killing Germans, and Sgt Gunderson (Holden) from Chicago, who takes command of the group.With the rescue of a British pilot, Winley (Heyborne), the group is complete. The obvious distrust/dislike between Winley and Shirl causes friction, but when the group finds out that Winley holds vital intelligence that will greatly aid the Allies in the ongoing \"Battle of the Bulge\", they agree to get him across 20 miles behind enemy lines to army intelligence.Several close encounters with Germans ensue. Deacon's psychosis continues to escalate as his visions intensify. We find out that in a recent skirmish, Deacon accidentally killed 2 woman and 6 children while trying to take out a sniper. We get to learn more about the lives of the soldiers and in one telling scene, the deep religious feelings of Deacon and contrasted with the agnostic Gould as each of them tells the story of holding a dying soldier.The men stumble upon a remote house occupied by a French woman and her child. They are warmly welcomed by the woman who provides them shelter and food. A massive winter storm slows the group as they hole up at the woman's place. Winley tries to to take off alone and a German patrol soon shows up at the house. The soldiers attack the Germans while the sharp-shooting Deacon misses an escaping German at point blank range twice. The German is caught by Winley and returned to the group. As they argue about whether they should execute the prisoner, Deacon recognizes him as a German he once encountered in his missionary work. He attributes his missing the escaping German to a divine intervention.During the night, Deacon allows the German to escape in exchange for some information about troop movements. The soldiers leave the next morning but Gunderson is shot and killed by a German patrol. A full scale fight ensues and Winley is wounded. Shirl is shot carrying Winley to safety and the two finally make peace just before Shirl dies.The three survivors are approached by a German soldier as they try to revive Winley. It turns out to be the same German that Deacon had let escape the night before. He allows them to escape and they grab an abandoned jeep and head toward the Allied lines. Disguised as German medics with a wounded soldier, they work through their way through the German lines. The Americans, thinking they are German begin shooting at them and the Germans are firing at them from behind as well. Deacon tries to hold off the Germans while Winley escapes with Gould, but is shot and killed in the fire fight. His dying vision is of the family he accidentally killed.Winley and Gould make it to Allied command and the critical information helps stop the German's offensive leading to an Allied victory in the Battle of the Bulge. Gould finds Deacon's body and takes his Bilble, thanking Deacon for saving his life."

          "During the early 1950s, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey), an up-and-coming young screenwriter, is accused of being a Communist because he attended an antiwar meeting in college years before, a meeting he claims he only attended to impress a girl. In an instant, his new film is pushed back for a few months, the credit is given to someone else, his movie star girlfriend leaves him, and his contract with the studio is dropped.His career in ruins, he gets drunk and accidentally drives his car off a bridge while trying to avoid an opossum. When he wakes up, his memory is lost and he is in a small town called Lawson after being fished out by Stan Keller (James Whitmore) who takes him to the local doctor named Doc Stanton (David Ogden Stiers). The townsfolk believe him to be Luke Trimble, one of the town boys killed in World War II 9 years before, and embrace him as a symbol of hope. \"Luke\" is at first mildly hesitant to embrace this life but he eventually settles in to \"his old life\", and with his \"father\" Harry (Martin Landau) and his \"girlfriend\" Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden), starts to restore The Majestic theater, an old movie house that had been closed because of hard times.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Congressional committee member Elvin Clyde (Bob Balaban) is convinced that Appleton's disappearance is proof that he is a Communist. No one in Hollywood knows about the accident. Clyde sends two federal agents to search for him. Back in Lawson, not everyone believes that \"Luke\" is back. Bob Leffert (Karl Bury), a one-handed soldier who knew the real Luke and did not like him not only is convinced that Peter is not Luke, he also believes that this stranger is setting the town up for more heartbreak. Others question where Luke has been for so long, and what he has been doing in the interim.A few days later, the town throws a welcome home party for \"Luke\" headed by Mayor Ernie Cole (Jeffrey DeMunn). The town then asks him to play the piano which he used to do when he was a kid. But instead of playing one of the classics he was taught to play, he eventually falls into a roadhouse boogie tune. On his way home, he runs into Bob, who confronts him with the suspicions he has had about \"Luke\", and then punches him when Peter makes a remark about how the war must have changed him. Finally Peter, Harry, Adele and the rest of the townsfolk succeed in rebuilding The Majestic. In the event, Peter also convinces the town to finally display a memorial that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had commissioned for after the war, but that the town did not have the heart to erect.Peter regains his memory when the Majestic shows a movie he wrote called \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara.\" At the same moment, Harry has a heart attack before the reel change. Moments later, Doc reveals that Harry's lungs have flooded and that he will die soon. At Harry's death bed, Peter lets him die believing that he is really his son.Immediately after the funeral, he tells Adele that he is not Luke. The whole town discovers the truth when federal agents Ellerby (Daniel von Bargen) and Saunders (Shawn Doyle) confront him publicly after two boys discover his car washed up on the beach. When Sheriff Cecil Coleman (Brent Briscoe) asks if he can help the federal agents with something, the agents present Peter with a summons to appear before Congress.That night at the Majestic, Peter's agent advises him to \"admit\" and then denounce his past associations with the Communist Party, and presents him with a list of named \"Communists\" that he could read before the court to clear his name. Initially, Peter reluctantly agrees to this plan, but an argument with Adele and a letter he finds that was written as a sort of \"goodbye letter\" from the real Luke (voiced by Matt Damon) trying to explain to Adele that he knows he is dying for a real cause inspire Peter to instead confront the committee.At the hearing headed up by Congressman Doyle (Hal Holbrook) which is televised with the citizens of Lawson also watching, Peter makes an impassioned speech about American ideals, which wins the crowd over. Fearing a political backlash, the lawmakers let him go free. Peter then finds out that it was in fact the girl that he went to the college meeting with years before that named him to the committee (it is revealed that she had since become a producer for Studio One).Peter then returns to Lawson, fearing an unwelcome reception. To Peter's surprise, he receives a hero's welcome from the town's citizens, who have come to respect Peter as an individual. In an epilogue, Peter settles in Lawson, marries Adele, and they have a son."

          "Peter Appleton is an ambitious young screenwriter working for HHS Studios during Hollywood's Golden Age--1951 in particular. \"Ashes to Ashes\" is about to be released, and he's dating its attractive star, Sandra Sinclair. Just when everything seems to be going his way, it is discovered that he (unwittingly) attended a Communist meeting during college when dragged there by his girlfriend at the time; thus, heavy suspicion settles over him and he must stand before Congress. Afraid of what might happen if they don't, HHS cancels Appleton's contract and aborts the film's release. Appleton promptly plunges into self-pity and spends nearly a whole night at a bar, then drives intoxicated through the streets of California until he plummets into a stormy river and is knocked unconscious. He washes up on the beaches of a small town called Lawson. The citizens are pleasant and likable, but the town is depressed and lifeless after losing 62 of its sons in World War II. One of them, Luke Trimble, was Missing in Action, and miraculously, Peter bears a striking resemblance to the black-and-white photos: close enough to fool even Luke's father Harry. And the alcohol and blow to the head have brought on amnesia, so Peter decides that he must be who they think he is. Besides, it's not a bad life: Luke's beautiful girlfriend, lawyer Adele Stanton, is all over him; the town has sudden sprung back to life with excitement, and he and his \"father\" rebuild a movie palace Harry used to run, The Majestic. Unfortunately, Peter's memory returns in time for G-men to track him down.",
          "Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, an egoistic studio scriptwriter in post-WWII Hollywood. Appleton's career is just getting off the ground when his name comes to the attention of a Congressional committee investigating the Communist affiliations of prominent Americans. Finding himself blacklisted by his studio, Appleton drinks too much, then goes for a long drive. He awakens on a deserted beach near a small town, but besides not knowing where he is, he doesn't know who he is or where he's supposed to be. The residents of Lawton, the small town, are calling him \"Luke Trimble,\" because Appleton bears an uncanny resemblance to their much-beloved hometown boy. In the weeks that follow, the townspeople \"remind\" Appleton why Luke was so well-liked, and finds himself living up to a new set of values he never possessed prior to his accident--and liking himself the better for it.",

          "In this Capra-esque drama set during the 1950s Blacklist, ambitious young screenwriter Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) loses his job and his identity, only to find new courage, love, and the power of conviction in the heart of a small town's life.",
          "Peter Appleton is a scriptwriter during the 1950s who is falsely suspected of being a Communist by many Hollywood film people. When this gets the film he was working on canceled, he gets drunk, gets into a freak car accident, and ends up in a small California town suffering from amnesia. He goes to stay in a rundown movie theater, where he learns the magic of experiencing a movie in it. But before long, the Communist hunters track him down and order him to testify before a Senate hearing committee."

          "In the film's prologue, a hotelier ushers a child into a bomb shelter during the Liverpool Blitz. We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles. Before departing from the house, she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child's pillow, twined around a single rose.Years later, 16-year-old Stella Bradshaw (Georgina Cates) lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon (Alun Armstrong) and Aunt Lily (Rita Tushingham) in Liverpool. Lacking an adult in her life that she feels close to, she frequently goes into phone booths to speak with her mother, who never appears in the film. Stella has no interest in schoolwork and her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at Woolworths, signs her up for speech lessons and pulls the strings to get her involved at a regional playhouse. After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter (Hugh Grant), the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director.The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Potter, whose homosexuality completely eludes her. Potter reveals himself to be a cruel, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension and has a long history of exploiting young men. His latest dalliance is with Geoffrey (Alan Cox), another teenage apprentice. Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes the object of passes from several men surrounding the theatre company, among them P.L. O'Hara (Alan Rickman), a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe for a stint playing Captain Hook in its Christmas production of Peter Pan. In keeping with theatrical tradition, O'Hara also doubles in the role of Mr. Darling.O'Hara carries himself with grace and charisma, but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast. Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love (who, he believes, bore him a son he never knew), O'Hara embarks on an affair with Stella, to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection. Stella, who still has her mind set on winning Potter's favor, remains emotionally detached but takes advantage of O'Hara's affections, seeing it as an opportunity to gain sexual experience. Disturbed by Stella's pursuance of the abusive Potter, O'Hara visits her aunt and uncle, who fill him in on Stella's history. He soon finds out that Stella's long-missing mother was his lost love, whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris, making Stella who he's been sleeping with his child, a daughter rather than the son he had imagined.Keeping his discovery to himself, O'Hara gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport. Distracted, he slips on the wet gangplank, hits his head and is pitched into the water.Potter takes on the role of Captain Hook for the last performance. Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone to \"her mother\" as has been her habit throughout the film. We are suddenly reminded that the absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock. It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter's confidences."
